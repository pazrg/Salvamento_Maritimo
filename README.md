# Salvamento_Maritimo

This is an angular js project for SASEMAR (also known as Salvamento Maritimo).
This project was developed in 10 days, so it has a lot bugs to be resolved.

It was initially developed with OpenLayers but finally chosen Leaflet instead 
just because its angular directive was proven to be easier to deal with.

This application aims to be a document manager for SASEMAR. It allows them to upload oceanographic 
variables (wind, currents etc: .tsv within /meteo directory) if they have it and, as core of this application,
an infinite number of .csv (a 14 .csv sample within /prueba directory) that contains the lat/lng positions of
different drifting buoys. They can upload them and have a visual tool of its tracks & end-markers and, in addition,
certain tools for filtering, processing and graph representation (this last added last minute without any angular directive, 
so just ignore it). 

I want to attach also a video to show how it works, but untill then, here you have the required files.

Thank you.
